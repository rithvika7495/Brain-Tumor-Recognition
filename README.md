# Brain-Tumor-Recognition
Brain tumor detection is a machine learning project that aims to accurately classify brain MRI images as either containing a tumor or being healthy. The project involves preprocessing the image data, training a deep learning model using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and evaluating the model's performance on a test dataset. The final output of the project is a trained model that can be used to automatically classify new brain MRI images as either healthy or containing a tumor. This project has potential applications in the medical field for aiding doctors in diagnosing brain tumors at an early stage.
